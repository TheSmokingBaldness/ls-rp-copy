# LS-RP Inspired gamemode a.k.a 1:1 Copy (used by Continental Roleplay)

This is a LS-RP inspired gamemode that is trying to copy most of LS-RP's features.
It is pretty much unfinished and far from production ready.

This is also known as Legacy Roleplay and Lux-RP gamemode.

Continental Roleplay is using it. They've applied some fixes to their gamemode and failed their opening.
Pretty much toxic brats that don't give credits to the people that have actually made this gamemode.
Also, they used a half-working Sublime UCP.

They are trying to sell something that hasn't even been made by them but just edited.
Tried to insult me on Discord DM's but failed.

This is their thread where they try to sell the gamemode: https://www.multimart.org/topic/5621-4sale-lsrp-script-samp-includes-ucp-maps-models-poker/
This is their Discord they're trying to sell along with (probably) nulled forums: https://discord.gg/croleplay
